====
NOTE: The test scripts will perform GUI scripting. 
EXPECT SIMULATED USER ACTIVITY - such as creating new tabs and windows - 
and therefore lots of FLASHING - throughout running the whole suite of tests.

INDIVIDUAL TESTS MAY FAIL *INTERMITTENTLY*.
When in doubt, run failing tests INDIVIDUALLY to see if they succeed:
CD TO THE ./test SUBDIR and RUN THEM FROM THERE.

!! Due to using a *.scpt file (utils.scpt) - which we need in order to be able
!! to use `load script` - and the *.scpt file having been compiled on 
!! macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), the tests will NOT run on earlier versions.
